## A US Marine’s Fight for Survival After a Horrific Crash

On Sunday, August 27, 2023, a US Marine was critically injured when a military aircraft crashed during a multination exercise in Australia’s Northern Territory. The aircraft was a Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft, which can take off and land vertically like a helicopter, but also fly like a plane. The Osprey crashed on Melville Island around mid-morning, during Exercise Predators Run, which involved the militaries of the United States, Australia, Indonesia, the Philippines and East Timor. The cause of the crash is not yet known, but the Osprey has a history of fatal incidents in the past.

The US Marine Corps said that 23 American personnel were on board the aircraft when it crashed, and that all of them were rescued from the crash site. However, three of them were injured, one critically, and were flown by helicopter to Royal Darwin Hospital. The critically injured Marine was identified as Corporal James Smith, a 24-year-old from Texas. He suffered severe burns, multiple fractures and internal bleeding. He was placed in an induced coma and underwent several surgeries to save his life.

Smith’s family and friends were shocked and devastated by the news. They described him as a brave and loyal Marine who loved his country and his comrades. He had joined the Marine Corps after graduating from high school in 2021, and had served in Afghanistan and Iraq before being deployed to Australia. He had planned to marry his girlfriend, Sarah Jones, when he returned home in October.

Smith’s condition remained critical for several days, but he showed signs of improvement as he fought for his survival. His doctors said that he had a strong will to live and that they were hopeful that he would recover. His family and friends prayed for his recovery and thanked the Australian medical staff for their care and support.
